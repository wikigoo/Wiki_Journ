8. **Final Delivery** → Present polished results

### Key Transferable Elements:
- **Step Dependencies**: Clear progression logic
- **Output Specifications**: Structured deliverable formats
- **Word Count Discipline**: ~80 words per prompt
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in validation checkpoints

## Universal Template Framework

### STEP 1: Domain Expert Assignment Template
```
You are a [DOMAIN] Expert specializing in [SPECIFIC_FOCUS]. Your expertise includes: [KEY_SKILL_1], [KEY_SKILL_2], [KEY_SKILL_3], and [KEY_SKILL_4]. You apply [METHODOLOGY_APPROACH] across components, [IMPROVEMENT_TYPE] improvements, and [REFINEMENT_PROCESS] methodologies. Maintain consistency throughout this chain, building each step upon previous findings while tracking all modifications and rationale. Confirm your role and readiness to proceed with [TARGET_OBJECTIVE].
```

### STEP 2: Analysis Framework Template
```
Establish your comprehensive analysis methodology for [SUBJECT_MATTER] evaluation. Define your approach across [NUMBER] dimensions: [DIMENSION_1] ([ASPECT_1], [ASPECT_2]), [DIMENSION_2] ([ASPECT_3], [ASPECT_4]), [DIMENSION_3] ([ASPECT_5]), [DIMENSION_4] ([ASPECT_6]), and [DIMENSION_5] ([ASPECT_7]). Specify your weighted evaluation system: Critical priorities ([X]%), High priorities ([Y]%), Moderate ([Z]%), Supporting ([W]%). Include [VALIDATION_METHODS] and quality standards for systematic improvement.
```

### STEP 3: Detailed Analysis Template
```
Analyze the provided [SUBJECT_ITEM] using your established methodology. Examine: [ANALYSIS_COMPONENT_1] and categorization, [ANALYSIS_COMPONENT_2] of [EVALUATION_ASPECT], [ANALYSIS_COMPONENT_3] of [QUALITY_MEASURE], [ANALYSIS_COMPONENT_4] for [MISSING_ELEMENTS], and [ANALYSIS_COMPONENT_5] prioritization. Organize findings into: strengths to preserve, critical issues requiring immediate attention, optimization opportunities, missing functionality, and integration improvements needed. Provide specific examples and evidence for each finding category.
```

### STEP 4: Enhancement Planning Template
```
Develop a specific, actionable enhancement plan based on your analysis findings. Categorize changes into: additions ([NEW_ELEMENTS] needed), modifications ([EXISTING_ELEMENTS] requiring changes), consolidations ([MERGE_TARGETS]), removals ([REDUNDANT_ELEMENTS]), and reorganizations ([STRUCTURAL_IMPROVEMENTS]). Assign priority levels, assess change complexity, map dependencies, and define quality validation checkpoints. Provide rationale and expected benefits for each proposed change in [DOMAIN_CONTEXT].
```

### STEP 5: Implementation Template
```
Implement the planned enhancements to create the optimized [DELIVERABLE_TYPE]. Apply all priority changes while preserving core functionality. Ensure clean integration, optimal clarity, and comprehensive coverage. Format the complete [OUTPUT_FORMAT] with: clear section headers, unambiguous instructions, logical flow with proper dependencies, efficient organization without redundancy, and professional presentation. Verify all components work together seamlessly for [INTENDED_USE_CASE].
```

### STEP 6: Documentation Template
```
Document all changes made during optimization. Provide: methodology summary (approach used, priority framework applied), detailed change categories ([CHANGE_TYPE_1], [CHANGE_TYPE_2], [CHANGE_TYPE_3], [CHANGE_TYPE_4]), preserved elements with rationale, and quality assurance summary. Include specific examples of modifications, explain rationale for each change category, and describe expected benefits in [DOMAIN_CONTEXT]. Organize documentation for easy reference and future maintenance.
```

### STEP 7: Quality Assurance Template
```
Conduct comprehensive [DELIVERABLE] validation using checklist: [QA_CRITERION_1], [QA_CRITERION_2], [QA_CRITERION_3], [QA_CRITERION_4], [QA_CRITERION_5], and [QA_CRITERION_6]. Create debugging framework covering: common issue categories ([ISSUE_TYPE_1], [ISSUE_TYPE_2], [ISSUE_TYPE_3], [ISSUE_TYPE_4]), debugging protocol ([DEBUG_STEP_1], [DEBUG_STEP_2], [DEBUG_STEP_3], [DEBUG_STEP_4]), and troubleshooting resources. Provide specific methods for identifying and resolving potential problems in the optimized [DELIVERABLE].
```

### STEP 8: Final Delivery Template
```
Deliver the final, completely optimized [FINAL_PRODUCT] in [FORMAT_SPECIFICATION]. Ensure: complete functionality implementation, optimal clarity in every [COMPONENT_TYPE], efficient organization without redundancy, professional formatting, and full validation completion. Include final validation summary, usage guidelines, maintenance recommendations, and performance optimization tips. Confirm the [DELIVERABLE] is ready for immediate deployment with all quality standards met and comprehensive documentation provided.
