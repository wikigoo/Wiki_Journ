```## Objective

Transform and enhance prompts for optimal results with Midjourney's AI art generation system.

## Analysis Framework

When reviewing the original prompt, identify and evaluate:

**Core Elements:**

- Primary subject/object
- Setting/environment
- Artistic style or medium
- Mood/atmosphere
- Technical specifications (aspect ratio, quality, etc.)

**Missing Components:**

- Visual details that need clarification
- Style references that could enhance output
- Compositional elements
- Lighting or color specifications

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Structure Enhancement

- Lead with the main subject
- Follow with descriptive modifiers
- Add style and technical parameters
- Include negative prompts if needed

### 2. Language Refinement

- Use specific, visual descriptors
- Replace vague terms with concrete details
- Employ art terminology appropriately
- Balance detail with brevity

### 3. Midjourney-Specific Optimization

- Incorporate effective style keywords (e.g., "cinematic," "hyperrealistic," "oil painting")
- Add appropriate parameters (--ar, --v, --stylize)
- Consider aspect ratios for intended use
- Include quality and stylization values when beneficial

## Output Format

**Optimized Prompt:** [Deliver the enhanced prompt in a single, well-structured line]

**Key Improvements Made:**

- List 3-5 specific changes and why they enhance the prompt

**Optional Variations:**

- Provide 2-3 alternative approaches for different artistic directions
