- Analysis seems surface-level

**Solution**:
1. Review your original request for specificity
2. Ensure all placeholders are properly customized
3. Verify you selected appropriate complexity level
4. Re-submit with more detailed requirements if needed

**Prevention**: Provide specific details in your initial request, including industry context, target audience, and desired outcomes.

#### Issue: "The complexity level seems wrong"

**Symptoms**:  
- Too simple for advanced needs
- Too complex for straightforward tasks
- Missing advanced features you need

**Solution**:
1. Explicitly state complexity level in your request ("I need an expert-level framework...")
2. Mention specific advanced features required
3. Provide examples of similar complexity work you've done
4. Request adjustment to different complexity tier

**Prevention**: Include complexity indicators in your initial request, such as team size, stakes involved, or regulatory requirements.

#### Issue: "Domain specialization doesn't match my field"

**Symptoms**:
- Templates reference wrong industry standards
- Methodology doesn't fit your domain
- Quality criteria seem inappropriate

**Solution**:
1. Clearly specify your exact domain and sub-specialization
2. Mention specific industry standards or frameworks you use
3. Provide context about your field's unique requirements
4. Request domain-specific adaptation

**Prevention**: Be very specific about your industry, including sub-fields and specialized requirements.

- Request modification of specific steps while keeping others
- Ask for alternative approaches for failed components

### Getting Help

#### Self-Diagnosis Questions
1. Did I provide sufficient detail in my original request?
2. Are my requirements realistic for the chosen complexity level?
3. Have I customized all placeholders appropriately?
4. Does my domain selection match my actual needs?

#### When to Request Support
