# Prompt System Analysis Chain

**Purpose**: Systematically analyze and optimize personal prompt systems through expert evaluation and structured improvement.

## STEP 1: Expert Role Assignment
**Dependencies**: None | **Output**: Role confirmation with key capabilities

```
You are a Prompt Engineering Expert specializing in personal AI system optimization. Your expertise includes: structural analysis, technical optimization using current best practices, quality assurance, and comprehensive documentation. You apply systematic evaluation across components, evidence-based improvements, and iterative refinement methodologies. Maintain consistency throughout this chain, building each step upon previous findings while tracking all modifications and rationale. Confirm your role and readiness to proceed.
```

## STEP 2: Analysis Methodology Framework
**Dependencies**: Step 1 | **Output**: Structured evaluation approach

```
Establish your comprehensive analysis methodology for prompt system evaluation. Define your approach across five dimensions: structural integrity (logical flow, dependencies), technical optimization (clarity, precision), functional completeness (goal achievement), quality assurance (ambiguity detection), and user experience (workflow efficiency). Specify your weighted evaluation system: Critical priorities (40%), High priorities (30%), Moderate (20%), Supporting (10%). Include debugging strategies and quality standards for systematic improvement.
```

## STEP 3: Detailed System Analysis
**Dependencies**: Step 2 | **Output**: Comprehensive analysis report

```
Analyze the provided prompt system using your established methodology. Examine: component inventory and categorization, structural assessment of logical flow, technical evaluation of instruction quality, gap identification for missing elements, and improvement opportunities prioritization. Organize findings into: strengths to preserve, critical issues requiring immediate attention, optimization opportunities, missing functionality, and integration improvements needed. Provide specific examples and evidence for each finding category.
```

---

## STEP 4: Enhancement Planning
**Dependencies**: Step 3 | **Output**: Prioritized improvement plan

```
Develop a specific, actionable enhancement plan based on your analysis findings. Categorize changes into: additions (new components needed), modifications (existing elements requiring changes), consolidations (components to merge), removals (redundant elements), and reorganizations (structural improvements). Assign priority levels, assess change complexity, map dependencies, and define quality validation checkpoints. Provide rationale and expected benefits for each proposed change.
```

---

## STEP 5: System Implementation
**Dependencies**: Step 4 | **Output**: Complete optimized system in code blocks

```
Implement the planned enhancements to create the optimized prompt system. Apply all priority changes while preserving core functionality. Ensure clean integration, optimal clarity, and comprehensive coverage. Format the complete system in clean code blocks with: clear section headers, unambiguous instructions, logical flow with proper dependencies, efficient organization without redundancy, and professional presentation. Verify all components work together seamlessly.
```

---

## STEP 6: Change Documentation
**Dependencies**: Step 5 | **Output**: Comprehensive change report

```
Document all changes made during optimization. Provide: methodology summary (approach used, priority framework applied), detailed change categories (major structural changes, content improvements, additions/enhancements, removals/consolidations), preserved elements with rationale, and quality assurance summary. Include specific examples of modifications, explain rationale for each change category, and describe expected benefits. Organize documentation for easy reference and future maintenance.
```

---

## STEP 7: Quality Assurance & Debugging
**Dependencies**: Step 6 | **Output**: Validation results and debugging guide

```
Conduct comprehensive system validation using checklist: completeness, clarity, consistency, logic flow, error handling, and efficiency. Create debugging framework covering: common issue categories (instruction ambiguity, logic flow problems, context loss, output quality), debugging protocol (issue identification, root cause analysis, solution development, validation testing), and troubleshooting resources. Provide specific methods for identifying and resolving potential problems in the optimized system.
```

---

## STEP 8: Final System Delivery
**Dependencies**: Step 7 | **Output**: Final polished system with validation summary

```
Deliver the final, completely optimized prompt system in clean code blocks. Ensure: complete functionality implementation, optimal clarity in every instruction, efficient organization without redundancy, professional formatting, and full validation completion. Include final validation summary, usage guidelines, maintenance recommendations, and performance optimization tips. Confirm the system is ready for immediate deployment with all quality standards met and comprehensive documentation provided.
