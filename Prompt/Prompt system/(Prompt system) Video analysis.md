"Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of this video to detect potential digital manipulation. Please examine the following elements systematically:

**Technical Artifacts:**

- Compression inconsistencies between different regions of the frame  
- Temporal anomalies (frame rate irregularities, motion blur inconsistencies)  
- Color space mismatches and unusual color gradients  
- Pixel-level artifacts, noise patterns, and digital fingerprints  
- Edge detection anomalies and unnatural boundary transitions

**Visual Authenticity Markers:**

- Lighting direction, intensity, and color temperature consistency across all elements  
- Shadow placement, opacity, and directionality relative to light sources  
- Reflection accuracy on surfaces (eyes, glasses, metallic objects)  
- Depth of field consistency and natural focus transitions  
- Perspective alignment and geometric accuracy

**Compositing Detection:**

- Green screen/chroma key indicators (color spill, edge feathering, halo effects)  
- Background-foreground integration quality  
- Scale and proportion consistency between layered elements  
- Motion tracking accuracy and natural movement patterns

**AI/Deepfake Signatures:**

- Facial landmark stability and natural micro-expressions  
- Skin texture consistency and pore detail authenticity  
- Hair strand behavior and natural physics  
- Blinking patterns and eye movement naturalness  
- Audio-visual synchronization accuracy

**Analysis Requirements:**

- Examine multiple frames at different timestamps  
- Compare suspicious regions with established authentic reference points  
- Identify specific timestamps where anomalies occur  
- Rate confidence level (1-10) for each finding

**Output Format:** Provide a structured report with: (1) Executive summary of authenticity assessment, (2) Detailed findings by category with specific evidence, (3) Confidence score and reasoning, (4) Recommendations for further verification if needed."
